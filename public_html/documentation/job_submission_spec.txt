Description of Process
******************************
 
1. User selects a protein from the "proteins" array from "start_job_submit_game" response
2. User selects a ligand/conformation from the pool of all conformations
3. User is then presented with protein and ligand together and is asked to rotate ligand until it "fits" in protein
4. User submits job

Feedback will be given on a seperate results page

Rotation:
Rotation is represented by a axis vector and a rotation angle phi per the CHARMM COOR ROTA spec:

The ROTAte command will cause the specified atoms to be rotated
about the specified axis vector through the specified center. The vector
need not be normalized, but it must have a non-zero length. If the AXIS
keyword is used, then the axis and center information from the last
COORdinates AXIS command will be used. The PHI value gives the amount
of rotation about this axis in degrees.
